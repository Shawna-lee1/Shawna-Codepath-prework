## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes


My biggest challenge while building this application was making a couple mistakes while making a connection between the UI and Logic. When I made the connection from the button to the ViewController swift code I didn't double check to see if it was set to IBAction. When I realized the mistake I wasn't sure how I would be able to change the event from IBOutlet to IBAction so I made another connection. However, this made me get more errors because now I have two connections. Eventually, I was able to fix my mistake and my code began to work. I was able to successfully change the background of the UI using the button.
